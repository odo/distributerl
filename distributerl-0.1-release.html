This is the second release of distributerl.  The first had no version number, and was mainly intended to get the code into the hands of other potential users and experimenters as quickly as possible -- motivated by requests for such code by projects including but not limited to the
<a href="http://kai.wiki.sourceforge.net/">Kai</a> project.

The distributerl-0.1 release is driven by two improvements to the Merkle Tree module:

<ol>
 <li>User-specified keys for objects are now arbitrary terms instead of being restricted to 160b binaries.</li>
 <li>A bug that caused incorrect diff/2 results has been fixed.
</ol>

<p>
Due to item #2, any systems making use of merkerl.erl should upgrade.
<p>

A couple of smaller handy features were also added:
<ol>
 <li>New function merkerl:delete/2 means that items can be deleted from trees.</li>
 <li>New function merkerl:allkeys/1 will return the keys for all objects in a tree.</li>
</ol>

(The vclock and chash modules are unchanged in this release)

Upcoming releases will include generic versioned objects, gossip protocol, and proper packing of the modules.
