distributerl
============

Building blocks for Erlang/OTP systems using distributed algorithms.

This is clone of the google code project of the same name. 

The code on google is released under the Apache License 2.0 and was written by Justin Sheehy and Andy Gross of Basho Technologies.

I am working on turning this code into such a form that rebar can load it as a dependency. And maybe add some test and other small changes.
